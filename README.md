# LunarSign
This Python code is an implementation of a dynamic Chinese zodiac that can be used to determine the Chinese zodiac based on the current year.

## Installation
To use this code, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## Usage
To use this code, simply run the chinese_zodiac.py file using Python. The code will determine the current year using the datetime module and use it to determine the corresponding Chinese zodiac using a dictionary of Chinese zodiacs.

The code will then print out the current Chinese zodiac in the format "The current Chinese zodiac is {zodiac}."
